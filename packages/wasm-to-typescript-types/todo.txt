# TODO List

## STUPIDLY CRITICAL

- need to rename $main to $entry via Rust (or maybe not?)
- need to figure out why entry requires arguments [0, 0]

## Important

update typescript patch for truncation limit

store the type of locals so LocalGet has a properly sized fallback

## Implementation improvements

look into an MSB->LSB addition operation.  will be a huge savings.

create a type for wasm runtime entry

## Refactors

## Other

- validation for input arguments not matching the entry function's signature

- look into variance annotations

- add program-wide stats

- noErrorTruncation short

### once Doom runs

- publish as an NPM (lol)
